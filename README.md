# PSKZero for Raspberry Pi Zero 
This is a group of scripts that are designed to generate a beacon sentence for PSK31lx (extended version) which will run on a Raspberry Pi Zero in console mode. 

Requirements are Jessie or Stretch (I have not tried Wheezy, in theory it should work). 
dependencies : ncurses, dialog and of cource the extended psk31lx (hopefully I'll get permission to post that here soon) 

sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev 

sudo apt-get install dialog 

sudo git clone http://github.com/w5dmh/PSKZero.git
